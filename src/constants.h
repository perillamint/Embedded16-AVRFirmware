 * Idle thread stack size
 *
 * This needs to be large enough to handle any interrupt handlers
 * and callbacks called by interrupt handlers (e.g. user-created
 * timer callbacks) as well as the saving of all context when
 * switching away from this thread.
 *
 * In this case, the idle stack is allocated on the BSS via the
 * idle_thread_stack[] byte array.

/*
 * Main thread stack size
 *
 * Note that this is not a required OS kernel thread - you will replace
 * this with your own application thread.
 *
 * In this case the Main thread is responsible for calling out to the
 * test routines. Once a test routine has finished, the test status is
 * printed out on the UART and the thread remains running in a loop
 * flashing a LED.
 *
 * The Main thread stack generally needs to be larger than the idle
 * thread stack, as not only does it need to store interrupt handler
 * stack saves and context switch saves, but the application main thread
 * will generally be carrying out more nested function calls and require
 * stack for application code local variables etc.
 *
 * With all OS tests implemented to date on the AVR, the Main thread
 * stack has not exceeded 201 bytes. To allow all tests to run we set
 * a minimum main thread stack size of 204 bytes. This may increase in
 * future as the codebase changes but for the time being is enough to
 * cope with all of the automated tests.
